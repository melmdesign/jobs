# Senior Designer (m/w)

### About SumUp

We are the leading mobile point-of-sale (mPOS) company in Europe. We started out 5 years ago, building our payment service from scratch and in the process, changing the card acceptance industry forever. We created a unique device which alongside a smartphone, allows small merchants to accept card payments anywhere. Whether our merchants are brewing coffee or fixing cars, we ensured our products were something anyone could understand, so our merchants can get back to what they do best. From our paperless onboarding to taking the first payment, we make it easy. 

Today, hundreds of thousands of small businesses in 30 countries around the world rely on SumUp to get paid. In addition to our original hardware, mobile and web apps we have gone on to develop a suite of APIs and SDKs to integrate SumUp payment into other apps and services.

### The Design Team

Joining the Design team will be interesting for you if you’re excited by the potential to work with many different platforms/mediums with a desire and hunger to constantly improve and innovate in these spaces.

We have physical hardware (made in Berlin), localized websites, mobile apps on iOS and Android, third-party integrations and a merchant-facing web app. The Team is located in Berlin and Sao Paolo, Brazil covering everything from User Experience and Interaction Design to Brand and Communication Design.

Help us bring card acceptance to the masses!
